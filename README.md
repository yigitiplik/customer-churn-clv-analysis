# customer-churn-clv-analysis
Customer churn prediction and CLV analysis using Python.

# Customer Churn Prediction & CLV Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (original Kaggle dataset) and builds a predictive model supported by Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) segmentation.
The goal is to help businesses understand why customers leave and which customer groups carry the highest long-term value.

# Key Features
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Missing value handling
* Distribution checks
* Churn vs non-churn comparisons

## Machine Learning Model

* Logistic Regression with:
* OneHotEncoding
* StandardScaler
* ColumnTransformer Pipeline
* ROC-AUC, classification report, confusion matrix

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

* Estimated CLV = MonthlyCharges × tenure
* Segmentation: Low / Mid / High value customers
* Churn rate by CLV segment

## Business Insights

* Which customers churn the most?
* Which contract types are risky?
* Which CLV categories have the highest churn?
* How retention strategies should change?

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Pathlib
* Jupyter / .py script

## How to Run

cd customer-churn-clv-analysis

python notebooks/churn_clv_analysis.py


This script performs:

* Data loading
* Cleaning & preprocessing
* Model training
* CLV estimation
* Insight extraction (contract type, CLV segment, etc.)

Console output includes:

* Classification report
* ROC-AUC score
* Confusion matrix
* Churn rate by contract
* Churn rate by CLV segment

## Business Value

* This analysis helps organisations:
* Identify customers who are most likely to leave
* Understand high-risk contract types
* Prioritize retention efforts based on CLV
* Reduce churn-driven revenue loss
* Improve long-term profitability

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

* Add Random Forest / XGBoost models
* Add SHAP explainability for feature importance
* Build interactive dashboards (Streamlit / Power BI)
* Calculate discounted CLV using probabilistic churn survival
