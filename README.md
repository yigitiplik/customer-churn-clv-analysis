Customer churn prediction and CLV analysis using Python.

# Customer Churn Prediction & Lifetime Value Analysis

This project demonstrates customer churn prediction and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimation using Python.
It covers exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and business interpretation.

# Key Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* RFM feature engineering
* Churn classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
* CLV calculation
* Visualisation of churn patterns
* Model evaluation (accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix)

# Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

# Project Structure

/data         → raw & cleaned datasets  
/notebooks    → Jupyter notebooks  
/models       → trained ML models  
/visuals      → plots & charts

# Business Value

This analysis helps organisations:

* Predict which customers are at risk of leaving
* Identify profitable segments
* Target customers based on predicted value
* Improve retention strategies

# Next Steps

* Upload dataset
* Create churn prediction notebook
* Add CLV calculation code
* Add visualisations to “visuals” folder
